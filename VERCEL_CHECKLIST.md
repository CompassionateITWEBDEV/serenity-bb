# ‚úÖ Vercel Deployment Checklist

Use this checklist to ensure your deployment succeeds:

## Before Deploying

- [ ] **Environment Variables Set in Vercel**
  - [ ] `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` 
  - [ ] `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
  - [ ] `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`
  - [ ] Set for: Production, Preview, Development

- [ ] **Local Build Test**
  ```bash
  pnpm install --no-frozen-lockfile
  pnpm run build
  ```
  - [ ] Build completes without errors
  - [ ] No TypeScript errors
  - [ ] No missing dependencies

- [ ] **Environment Variable Verification**
  ```bash
  npm run verify-env
  ```
  - [ ] All required variables present
  - [ ] Values are correct (not placeholders)

## During Deployment

- [ ] **Push to Git** or **Deploy via Vercel CLI**
- [ ] **Monitor Build Logs** in Vercel dashboard

## After Deployment

- [ ] **Test the deployed site**
  - [ ] Home page loads
  - [ ] Login works

## If Build Fails

1. [ ] Check Vercel build logs for specific error
2. [ ] Verify environment variables are set correctly
3. [ ] Ensure Node.js version is 20 (check package.json)
4. [ ] Try redeploying (sometimes transient errors occur)
5. [ ] Contact Vercel support with error details
