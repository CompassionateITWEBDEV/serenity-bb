# Zoho Meeting Shared Conference Setup

## ‚úÖ **Complete Implementation**

The system now works exactly as you requested! When someone initiates a call, both staff and patient automatically join the SAME Zoho meeting conference.

## üéØ **How It Works**

### **1. Call Initiation**
When staff or patient clicks the call button:

1. **System generates ONE unique meeting link** for the conversation
2. **Meeting link is stored** in memory for that conversation (reusable for 1 hour)
3. **Caller automatically opens** the meeting in a new tab
4. **Meeting link is sent** as a message in the chat

### **2. Call Acceptance**
When the other party receives the call notification:

1. **They click "Accept"**
2. **System retrieves the SAME meeting link** from the conversation
3. **They join the SAME meeting room** as the caller
4. **Both wait for each other** in the Zoho conference
