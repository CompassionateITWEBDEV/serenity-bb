# Zoho Meeting Authentication Plan

## 🎯 **Current System Flow**

### **How It Works Now:**

1. **Users MUST sign in first** ✅
   - Staff and Patients log into your application
   - Authentication happens through Supabase
   - Users need accounts in your system

2. **After Login:**
   - Users go to dashboard/messages
   - They can chat with each other
   - They can initiate calls

3. **Call Flow:**
   - User clicks call button
   - System uses configured `ZOHO_MEETING_URL`
   - Both users join the SAME Zoho meeting room
   - **No additional sign-in needed** for the meeting

## ✅ **Why This Works**

### **Good News:**
- **Users don't need Zoho accounts!** 🎉
- They use **your shared meeting room**
- One Zoho Meeting URL works for everyone
- No additional authentication required

### **How:**
1. **You (admin) configure ONE Zoho meeting room**
2. **All users (staff and patients) use that same room**
3. **Zoho Meeting allows "join without sign-in"**
4. **Anyone with the link can join**

## 💡 **Alternative Options**

### **Option A: Current Setup (Recommended)** ⭐
- **One shared meeting room for everyone**

### **Option B: Dynamic Meetings (Complex)**
- **Create new meeting for each call**
- **Pros**: Separate rooms per conversation
- **Cons**: Requires Zoho API integration, more complex
