# Deployment Fix Summary

## Problem
You were getting an "unexpected error" when building on Vercel, even though the build works locally.

## Root Causes Identified

1. **Missing Environment Variables** - The middleware requires Supabase environment variables, but they weren't properly configured in Vercel
2. **No Error Handling** - The middleware would crash if environment variables were missing
3. **Large File Size** - The `/call/[conversationId]/page.tsx` is 3000+ lines (25 kB), which can cause build timeouts

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Enhanced Middleware Error Handling (`middleware.ts`)
- Added checks for missing environment variables
- Added try-catch for session fetching
- Middleware now fails gracefully instead of crashing the build

### 2. Optimized Vercel Configuration (`vercel.json`)
- Simplified build configuration
- Ensured proper framework detection
- Using standard Next.js build commands

### 3. Documentation Added
- **`.env.example`** - Lists all required environment variables
- **`VERCEL_DEPLOYMENT.md`** - Complete deployment guide
- **`scripts/verify-env.js`** - Script to verify environment setup

### 4. Package Scripts Updated (`package.json`)
- Added `verify-env` script to check environment variables
- Added `prebuild` hook to run verification before builds

## How to Deploy Successfully

### Step 1: Set Environment Variables in Vercel

Go to your Vercel project → Settings → Environment Variables and add:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...
```

**Make sure to set these for all environments: Production, Preview, and Development**

### Step 2: Verify Locally

```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm install --no-frozen-lockfile

# Verify environment variables
npm run verify-env

# Test build
pnpm run build
```

### Step 3: Deploy to Vercel

```bash
# Option A: Push to Git (recommended)
git add .
git commit -m "Fix: Add environment variable handling for Vercel deployment"
git push

# Option B: Deploy directly
vercel --prod
```

### Step 4: Monitor the Build

1. Go to Vercel dashboard
2. Check the deployment logs
3. Look for success message: "✓ Compiled successfully"

## Expected Results

After applying these fixes, you should see:

✅ Build completes successfully  
✅ No more "unexpected error" messages  
✅ Middleware handles missing variables gracefully  
✅ Environment variables properly loaded  

## If Build Still Fails

1. **Check Vercel build logs** for specific error messages
2. **Verify all environment variables** are set in Vercel dashboard
3. **Check Node.js version** - This project requires Node 20
4. **Contact Vercel support** with specific error from logs

## Performance Recommendations (Future)

The `/call/[conversationId]/page.tsx` file is very large (3000+ lines). Consider:

1. **Break into smaller components**
   - Extract `VideoTile` to separate file
   - Extract `CallControls` to separate file
   - Create a `hooks/useCallSetup.ts` for call logic

2. **Use code splitting**
   ```tsx
   const VideoTile = dynamic(() => import('./VideoTile'), { ssr: false });
   ```

3. **Lazy load heavy features**
   - Screen sharing logic
   - Audio level monitoring
   - Device testing utilities

This would reduce bundle size and improve build times.

## Files Changed

- `middleware.ts` - Added error handling
- `vercel.json` - Optimized configuration
- `.env.example` - Added environment variable template
- `package.json` - Added verification scripts
- `VERCEL_DEPLOYMENT.md` - Added deployment guide
- `scripts/verify-env.js` - Added verification script

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Review the changes
2. ✅ Set environment variables in Vercel
3. ✅ Test deployment
4. ⏳ Consider refactoring large files (optional)
